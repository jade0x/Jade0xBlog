Hi! I'm Jade! üëãüèª

I'm a self-taught web developer, currently focusing on JavaScript and Python. I enjoy learning about and seeing ideas come to life through coding.
In my free time, I am a runner, bookworm, table-top gamer and Aussie living abroad. I love spending time outdoors and with my friends, family and dog, Bu! Before diving into tech, I worked in non-profit community services as a Case Manager, and a volunteer for State Emergency Services. #SES

This blog is my "learning in public" journal‚Äîdocumenting progress and sharing thoughts. I'm interested in web development, open source projects, and making knowledge more accessible. I have a 'side-quest' with social media: learning how we got here, algorithms, the rise and spread of misinformation online, how our comprehension skills and attention spans are being affected.

If you're working on interesting projects or if you're open to mentoring, I'd love to connect
