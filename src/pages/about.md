Hi! I'm Jade, and I'm learning to code! üëãüèª

I'm a self-taught web developer, currently focusing on JavaScript and Python. I enjoy learning how to build things with code and seeing my ideas come to life.

In my free time, I like reading, running, table-top gaming and hanging out with my friends, family and dog, Bu. Before diving into tech, I worked in non-profit community services in a healthcare capacity.

This blog is my way of learning in public ‚Äì documenting my progress and sharing what I discover along the way. I'm interested in web development, open source projects, and using technology to make information more accessible. I am also on a "side-quest" with social media: how algorithms work, the spread of misinformation, and how our reading comprehension skills and attention spans are affected.

If you're working on interesting projects or if you're open to mentoring, I'd love to connect! You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jade0x), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jade-garafola/), [Twitter](https://x.com/_jade0x_) or [Bluesky](https://jade0x.bsky.social).
