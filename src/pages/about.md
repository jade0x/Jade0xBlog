Hi! I'm Jade, and I'm learning to code!

I'm a self-taught web developer, currently focusing on JavaScript and Python. I enjoy the process of learning how to build things with code and seeing my ideas come to life on screen.

In my free time, I like reading books, going for runs, and hanging out with my family (inc my dog Bu!). Before diving into tech, I worked in non-profit community services in a healthcare capacity.

This blog is my way of learning in public â€“ documenting my progress and sharing what I discover along the way. I'm interested in web development, open source projects, and using technology to make information more accessible.

If you're working on interesting projects or if you're open to mentoring, I'd love to connect! You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jade0x), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jade-garafola/), [Twitter](https://x.com/_jade0x_) or [Bluesky](https://jade0x.bsky.social).
