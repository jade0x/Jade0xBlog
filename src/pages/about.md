Hi! I'm Jade, and I'm learning to code! 👋🏻

I'm a self-taught web developer, currently focusing on JavaScript and Python. I enjoy learning and seeing ideas come to life through coding.

In my free time, I like reading, running, table-top gaming and hanging out with my friends, family and dog, Bu. Before diving into tech, I worked in non-profit community services as a Case Manager, in a healthcare capacity.

This blog is my way of learning in public – documenting progress and sharing along the way. I'm interested in web development, open source projects, and using technology to make information more accessible. I am also on a "side-quest" with social media: understanding how algorithms work, the rise and spread of misinformation online, and how our reading comprehension skills and attention spans are being affected.

If you're working on interesting projects or if you're open to mentoring, I'd love to connect! You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jade0x), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jade-garafola/), [Twitter](https://x.com/_jade0x_) or [Bluesky](https://jade0x.bsky.social).
